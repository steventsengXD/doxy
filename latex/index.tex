This software will compute and visualise the ground state energy of the $H_{2}^{+}$ ion and $H_{2}$ molecule using the variational quantum Monte Carlo (V\+Q\+MC) method. The main output result will be the minimum energy of the system and the resulting wavefunction.

With the exception of user input and plotting the results, the code is written entirely in Fortran. For efficiency, parallelization has been implemented through Open\+MP to ... .

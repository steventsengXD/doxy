The variational quantum Monte Carlo method (V\+Q\+MC) is a computational method for approximating the ground state energy of a system. More often than not, the time-\/independent Schr√∂dinger equation of a system defined by the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ may not be solved to determine the system\textquotesingle{}s ground state energy $E_{gs}$. The {\itshape variational} {\itshape principle} from quantum mechanics provides that for any normalized function $\Psi$, we have \begin{equation}E_{gs} \leq \langle \Psi | \hat{H} | \Psi \rangle \equiv \langle \hat{H} \rangle, \end{equation} i.\+e., the expected value of $\hat{H}$ with an arbitrary $\Psi$ will most likely overestimate $ E_{gs}$, giving an upper bound for the ground state energy \cite{griffiths2018introduction}. It follows that $E_{gs}$ may be estimated through testing trial functions across combinations of parameter values and selecting as the approximate ground state wave function the one parameterized with the values that minimize $\langle \hat{H} \rangle$.

The expected value of $\hat{H}$ is
